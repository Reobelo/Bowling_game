Bowling Game Overview

Developer: Haben A.

Objective:
To create a simple single-player bowling game with a focus on clean code design, modularity, and simplicity in the user interface.

Design Patterns Used:

    # Model-View-Presenter (MVP)
    # Observer Pattern: for communication between the model and other observers

Features:

    # Single Player: The game is designed for a single player only.
    # UI Design: The front end is intentionally kept minimal, displaying only the necessary elements such as the scoreboard, action buttons, and game-results(textual).
    # Modularity: The code is organized into distinct panels and components. This modular approach makes it easier to manage, extend, and maintain the game.

Key Components:

    # ScoreBoardPanel: uses tiles for containing the results of each play.
    # Game Model: Manages the core logic of the bowling game, including scoring.
    # Toolbar and Panels: Separated into different classes to keep the UI components organized and maintainable.


Given the short time to code this mini-project, there are many shortcomings. There are also a lot that needs improvements.
